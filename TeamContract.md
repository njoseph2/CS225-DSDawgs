# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will want to try to meet weekly because we figure this will be a good amount of time for us to get ideas accross without spending too much time with each other. We have decided on Saturday at 5 PM as a tentative time unless complications arise. We will all come to meetings with ideas for the project so that we don't waste time during the meeting brainstorming and we all have an agenda to go over, and for us to have our time be as productive as possible. Each meeting we will have a discord groupchat to take notes on, and we will rotate turns on who takes the notes. We will try to meet at Grainger Library as this is a central location, but in the event people cannot attend in-person, we will reschedule the meeting to be held via Discord. Our meetings will last one hour, unless unanimously agreed upon to end early / stay longer.

2. **Assistance** 

We will all try communicating via discord as this is the central spot for CS225 in general so we figure that this would be a good place to communicate. Since all of us are comfortable with Discord, we should all be able to respond within 24 hours time to ensure no urgent updates go unnoticed. 

3. **Respect** 

Each team member will come with ideas and we will ensure everyone has a chance to speak about their ideas, using the notes that we take as a framework to ensure that everyone's opinions are heard. To ensure everyone will stay engaged during the meetings, after each individual shares their new updates from the week, we will have every group member respond to one another to ensure everyone is not only speaking, but also listening. We will maintain engagement by not using our phones during meetings (unless emergency) and bouncing off each other.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will take into account the different strengths and experience of teammates and assign work equally based on this. Additionally, we will utilize branch-based development to keep the workspace clean and keep track of all commits; when changes are made, we will be notified and keep tabs on the changes to ensure that there are no overrides. Unforeseen complications will be raised in the discord group chat, where we will potentially decide to call an emergency meeting to resolve the issue quickly.

5. **Time Commitment** 

We believe a good time commitment for the final project will be 3 hours outside of our designated meeting time, as this is equivalent to the time commitment for CS 222, which has a group project setting that is very similar. We do not expect to spend time over Thanksgiving break, but anticipate we will spend 3 hours every other week starting this week. If we see a commitment arise, we will notify our team members at a minimum of a week in advance, as this gives the rest of the group enough time to plan accordingly. In the event an emergency pops up where the week in advance notification is not possible, we will be understanding but have an agreement that these meetings will take priority over trivial commitments.  

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

We will resolve situations with disagreement by creating a pros and cons list, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each team member's ideas, and making decisions based on which solution has the most potential, avoiding the solutions with more complications. If a team member is late than 5:05 PM to a meeting, they must bring food to the next meeting to boost the team's morale. If we have issues with our code and have trouble debugging, we will communicate via our discord group chat to see if other team members have an idea for a solution remotely. If not, this will be a major discussion point during our meetings.
