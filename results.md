A written report. In addition to your code, your Github repository must contain a results.md file which describes:

The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.

# Algorithm Discussion

PageRank - Used to highlight most favored streamers based solely on mutual viewership with other users, where more popular streamers will land. In addition, this algorithm's intended use was to further simplify the way consumers could interact with our code, being able to better understand streamer relationships.

Force-directed Graph - Force-directed graph algorithm work in co-step with PageRank to allow users to visualize the Graph in a more interaction-based way. This algorithm used an attraction and repulsive force to tell itself how to graph. For example, if two nodes grew too near to eachother, the repulsion factor is used to distance them in a way that still displays the graph in a concise manner, while also highlighting relationships between different channels. Unlike PageRank, this algorithm is primarily focused on helping visualize the graph with their relationships being prominent in doing so.
